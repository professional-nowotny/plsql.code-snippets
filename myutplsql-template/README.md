## MyutPLSQL-template
> MyutPLSQL template can be used to create unit tests in Oracle. It is always easier to modify a template than to write everything from scratch.

### Structure
This tool includes two files:
1. package specification
2. package body

### Features
* template for the specification: this includes all mandatory annotations for utPLSQL. 
* template for the body with an AAA (arrange, act, assert) pattern 
* use of a global user variable when a user is required for an action (e.g. logging)
